        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>How to Make the Crepes:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put all of the ingredients for the crepes (in the order that they are listed below) in a blender and
                blend
                until well combined.
                <ul>
                    <li>½ cup water,</li>
                    <li>1 cup milk,</li>
                    <li>4 large eggs,</li>
                    <li>4 Tbsp butter or olive oil,</li>
                    <li>1 cup flour</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Melt a dot of butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat (2 skillets make the process go faster).
            </li>
            <li>As you are pouring into the skillet, swirl the batter to evenly coat the bottom. If you get any small
                gaps,
                you can fill them with more batter. Depending on the size of your skillet; add about 2-3 tbsp of batter.
                I use a small ladle.
            </li>
            <li>Once the bottom is lightly golden (about a minute or less) flip the crepe using a sharp edged spatula to
                easily get under the crepe. Let the other side get lightly golden and plop the crepe out onto a cutting
                board. Repeat with remaining batter; you may not need to dot with butter after the first time if your
                skillet is a good one (and remember there is butter in the batter). Don’t stack hot crepes on top of
                each other. Once they are just warm or room temp, they can be stacked. Don’t panic, my first crepe never
                turns out nice so I wolf it down to conceal the evidence!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to make cheese filling and complete nalesniki:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a colander, rinse the cottage cheese with cold water and drain well. Mash the cream cheese, cottage
                cheese
                and sugar with a potato masher until well combined and creamy. Cottage cheese will still be a little
                lumpy.
            </li>
            <li>Using a spatula, spread 2 generous Tablespoons of cheese filling on each crepe and sprinkle with about
                15
                raisins.
            </li>
            <li>Roll the crepe into a log and cut in half. Refrigerate crepes that aren’t being served. It keeps in the
                fridge
                for almost one week.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>To Serve:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt about 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet and sauté the rolled cheese crepes on medium heat until
                golden
                brown on both sides. They don't take long to sauté. Be careful not to burn them.
            </li>
            <li>Dust with powered sugar (optional) and serve with sour cream or jam on the side.</li>
        </ol>
